# KindnessCoin - Care Token System

## Overview

KindnessCoin is a blockchain-based application that allows users to share care messages and receive soul-bound NFTs as proof of received kindness. The application consists of two main smart contract types: CareToken (for sending care messages) and CareReceipt (for acknowledging received care). It uses a full-stack TypeScript architecture with React frontend, Express backend, and PostgreSQL database.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **UI Library**: Radix UI components with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui design system
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state and local React state
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Web3 Integration**: ethers.js for blockchain interactions and MetaMask integration

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **Session Management**: connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL-backed sessions
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with JSON responses

### Database Schema
- **users**: User authentication and profile data
- **care_tokens**: Records of sent care messages with blockchain transaction details
- **care_receipts**: Records of acknowledged care with sender/receiver relationships
- **contract_addresses**: Deployed smart contract addresses per network

## Key Components

### Smart Contract Integration
- **CareToken Contract**: Soul-bound NFTs representing sent care messages
- **CareReceipt Contract**: Soul-bound NFTs for acknowledging received care
- **Contract Deployment**: Mock deployment system with address tracking
- **Web3 Provider**: MetaMask browser extension integration

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Wallet-Based**: Primary authentication through MetaMask wallet connection
- **Network Support**: Multi-network compatibility with network ID tracking
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions for persistent state

### Core Features
- **Send Care**: Create and submit care messages to the blockchain
- **Receive Care**: Acknowledge received care with personalized messages
- **Care History**: View sent messages and received receipts
- **Transaction Tracking**: Real-time transaction status monitoring

## Data Flow

1. **User connects wallet** → MetaMask integration provides address and network
2. **Contract deployment** → Backend tracks contract addresses per network
3. **Send care message** → Frontend submits to smart contract, backend logs transaction
4. **Acknowledge care** → Receiver creates receipt NFT referencing original sender
5. **History retrieval** → Frontend queries both blockchain and database for comprehensive history

## External Dependencies

### Blockchain & Web3
- **ethers.js**: Ethereum blockchain interaction library
- **MetaMask**: Required browser extension for wallet functionality
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL for production deployments

### UI & Styling
- **Radix UI**: Accessible, unstyled component primitives
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Lucide React**: Icon library for consistent iconography

### Development & Build
- **Vite**: Frontend build tool with TypeScript support
- **Drizzle Kit**: Database migration and schema management
- **TanStack Query**: Server state management and caching

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Local Development**: Vite dev server with Express API proxy
- **Database**: Local PostgreSQL or Neon development database
- **Smart Contracts**: Mock deployment for testing without blockchain costs

### Production Environment
- **Frontend**: Static build served by Express with single-page app routing
- **Backend**: Node.js Express server with production optimizations
- **Database**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **Smart Contracts**: Actual blockchain deployment on target networks

### Environment Configuration
- **DATABASE_URL**: PostgreSQL connection string (required)
- **NODE_ENV**: Environment flag for development/production builds
- **Network Support**: Configurable blockchain network targets

## Recent Changes

### Contract Deployment System (June 28, 2025)
- Added ContractDeployer component for deploying smart contracts from the frontend
- Enhanced backend contract deployment with deterministic address generation
- Added three-tab navigation: Deploy, Send Care, Receive Care
- Deploy tab is active by default until contracts are deployed
- Send and Receive tabs are disabled until both contracts are deployed
- Added contract status tracking and visual feedback

## Changelog

- June 28, 2025. Initial setup with merged sender/receiver functionality
- June 28, 2025. Added smart contract deployment system
